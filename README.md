# PINNS

The following code in PINNS.ipynb is a representation of how neural networks could be used for solving equations using Rayleigh Ritz method. An artifical loss function is created for a 2D problem which is minimized by considering continus displacement fields for the x and y direction. Monte Carlo integration is used to perform the integration over the domain.
